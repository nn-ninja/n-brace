**n-brace** is a tool for visualizing and navigating your notes as a graph mind map.  
Itâ€™s designed around the *Pocket Brain* technique and helps you move smoothly through large knowledge network in Obsidian.

## Features

- **Focused view** â€“ show only the local part of the graph that youâ€™re currently exploring.
- **Bidirectional navigation** â€“ move easily through linked notes in both directions.
- **Automatic layout** â€“ the graph organizes itself, so you donâ€™t have to adjust nodes manually.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** â€“ jump between neighbors, switch directions, and move faster through your map.
- **Interactive and mobile-friendly** â€“ works smoothly on desktop and mobile devices <<not yet>>.
